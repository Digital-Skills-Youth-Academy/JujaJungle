                        that get buried in landfills may take up to 1,000 years to break down, and in the 
                        process, they separate into smaller and smaller toxic particles that contaminate 
                        soil and water. Furthermore, the production of plastic bags consume millions of 
                        gallons of oil that could be used for fuel and heating.

                            consider a better alternative to plastic bags, carry their own set of 
                            environmental problems. For example, according to the American Forest and 
                            Paper Association, in 1999 the U.S. alone used 10 billion paper grocery 
                            bags, which adds up to a lot of trees, plus a lot of water and chemicals
                            to process the paper.

                    <div class="subheader">By Kate Bratskeir</div><br>
                    <div class="body">When you visit the supermarket, is it better for the planet to carry home your groceries in a paper, 
                        plastic or reusable tote bag? The answer is more complicated than you might think. 
                        <p></p>
                        Plastic bags are cheap and convenient, but they’re a scourge on the planet.
                        And it turns out that certain kinds of reusable bags have a massive environmental
                        footprint, too. Paper is not a great choice either, especially if you’re going to throw it out after a single use.  
                        <p></p>
                        So which choice is the least bad? Well, it depends whom you ask.</div>

                    <div class="body"><p></p>The next time the clerk at your favorite grocery store asks
                        whether you prefer “paper or plastic” for your purchases, consider giving the 
                        truly eco-friendly response and saying, “neither.”
                        Plastic bags end up as litter that fouls the landscape and kill thousands of 
                        marine animals every year that mistake the floating bags for food. Plastic bags 
                        that get buried in landfills may take up to 1,000 years to break down, and in the 
                        process, they separate into smaller and smaller toxic particles that contaminate 
                        soil and water. Furthermore, the production of plastic bags consume millions of 
                        gallons of oil that could be used for fuel and heating.

                            Paper bags, which many people 
                            consider a better alternative to plastic bags, carry their own set of 
                            environmental problems. For example, according to the American Forest and 
                            Paper Association, in 1999 the U.S. alone used 10 billion paper grocery 
                            bags, which adds up to a lot of trees, plus a lot of water and chemicals
                            to process the paper.
                            <p></p><div class="subheader">Reusable Bags Are a Better Option</div><p></p>
                            But if you decline both paper and plastic bags, then how do you get your groceries home? 
                            <p></p>The answer, according to many environmentalists, is high-quality reusable shopping bags made of materials that don’t harm the environment during production and don’t need to be discarded after each use. You can find a good selection of high-quality reusable bags online, or at most grocery stores, department stores, and food co-operatives.
                            
                            
                            <p></p>Experts estimate that 500 billion to 1 trillion plastic bags are consumed and discarded annually worldwide — more than a million per minute.
                            
                            <p></p>Here are a few facts about plastic bags to help demonstrate the value of reusable bags to consumers and the environment:
                            <ul>
                            <li>Plastic bags are not biodegradable. They actually go through a process called photodegradation — breaking down into smaller and smaller toxic particles that contaminate both soil and water and end up entering the food chain when animals accidentally ingest them.
                            </li><li>According to the Environmental Protection Agency, more than 380 billion plastic bags are used in the United States every year. Of those, approximately 100 billion are plastic shopping bags, which cost retailers about $4 billion annually.
                            </li><li>According to various estimates, Taiwan consumes 20 billion plastic bags annually (900 per person), Japan consumes 300 billion bags each year (300 per person), and Australia consumes 6.9 billion plastic bags annually (326 per person).
                            </li><li>Hundreds of thousands of whales, dolphins, sea turtles, and other marine mammals die every year after eating discarded plastic bags they mistake for food.
                            </li><li>Discarded plastic bags have become so common in Africa they have spawned a cottage industry. People there collect the bags and use them to weave hats, bags, and other goods. According to the BBC, one such group routinely collects 30,000 bags every month.
                            </li></ul>
                            <p></p>Plastic bags as litter have even become commonplace in Antarctica and other remote areas. According to David Barnes, a marine scientist with the British Antarctic Survey, plastic bags have gone from being rare in the late 1980s and early 1990s to being almost everywhere in Antarctica.
                            
                            <p></p>Some governments have recognized the severity of the problem and are taking action to help combat it.
                            
                            <p></p><div class="subheader">Strategic Taxes Can Cut Plastic Bag Use</div><p></p>
                            In 2001, for example, Ireland was using 1.2 billion plastic bags annually, about 316 per person. In 2002, the Irish government imposed a plastic bag consumption tax (called a PlasTax), which has reduced consumption by 90 percent. The tax of $.15 per bag is paid by consumers when they check out at the store. Besides cutting back on litter, Ireland’s tax has saved approximately 18 million liters of oil. Several other governments around the world are now considering a similar tax on plastic bags.
                            
                            <p></p>Governments Use the Law to Limit Plastic Bags
                            <p></p>Japan passed a law that empowers the government to issue warnings to merchants that overuse plastic bags and don’t do enough to “reduce, reuse, or recycle.” In Japanese culture, it is common for stores to wrap each item in its own bag, which the Japanese consider a matter of both good hygiene and respect or politeness.
                            
                            <p></p><div class="subheader">Companies Making Tough Choices</div><p></p>
                            Meanwhile, some eco-friendly companies — such as Toronto’s Mountain Equipment Co-op — are voluntarily exploring ethical alternatives to plastic bags, turning to biodegradable bags made from corn. The corn-based bags cost several times more than plastic bags, but are produced using much less energy and will break down in landfills or composters in four to 12 weeks.

                    <div class="header"> Are Plastic, Paper Or Reusable Bags Better For The Environment?</div>
                    <div class="subheader">By Kate Bratskeir</div><br>
                    <div class="body">When you visit the supermarket, is it better for the planet to carry home your groceries in a paper, 
                        plastic or reusable tote bag? The answer is more complicated than you might think. 
                        <p></p>
                        Plastic bags are cheap and convenient, but they’re a scourge on the planet.
                        And it turns out that certain kinds of reusable bags have a massive environmental
                        footprint, too. Paper is not a great choice either, especially if you’re going to throw it out after a single use.  
                        <p></p>
                        So which choice is the least bad? Well, it depends whom you ask.</div>

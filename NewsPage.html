            <div class="header"> Why You Should Use Reusable Shopping Bags</div>
            <div class="subheader">By Larry West</div><br>
            <div class="body">The next time the clerk at your favorite grocery store asks
                 whether you prefer “paper or plastic” for your purchases, consider giving the 
                 truly eco-friendly response and saying, “neither.”
                Plastic bags end up as litter that fouls the landscape and kill thousands of 
                marine animals every year that mistake the floating bags for food. Plastic bags 
                that get buried in landfills may take up to 1,000 years to break down, and in the 
                process, they separate into smaller and smaller toxic particles that contaminate 
                soil and water. Furthermore, the production of plastic bags consume millions of 
                gallons of oil that could be used for fuel and heating.</div>
